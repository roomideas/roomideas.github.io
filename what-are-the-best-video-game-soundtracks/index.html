The 10 best video game soundtracks of 2017 From factmag.com</p>

A list of the very best video game soundtracks is ultimately an abbreviated history of video games themselves;</p>
<h3 id="journey-2012-thatgamecompanys-atmospheric-journey-is-the-first-video-game-to-ever-have-its-soundtrack-nominated-for-a-grammy-award">Journey (2012) thatgamecompany’s atmospheric journey is the first video game to ever have its soundtrack nominated for a grammy award.</h3><p>Sable is a calm and contemplative game, and its soundtrack matches that vibe perfectly. Now i can say what kind of music is my favorite with confidence. The last of us is clearly a cinematic game. Taking a page out of cartoons from the 1930s, the developers of cuphead filled the soundtrack with jazz and big band tracks, making the game feel like it came from a bygone era. This game’s soundtrack had the power to make you feel like a mighty hero in battle one moment and a calm soul wandering through the pines the next. More game of the year awards.</p>
