10 Best Grand Strategy Games To Play in 2019/2020 GAMERS From gamersdecide.com</p>
<p>Grand strategy as a genre is pretty much only games made by paradox (not published by them, mind you), and of those i personally found hoi4 to be the easiest to get into. It’s a lot easier to learn when someone is explaining stuff to you simpler terms while you play. As a king, we have been chosen in xcom 2, called war of the chosen. Just watch someone do a playthrough of it and you can pick up a lot of the basics easily, there�s not much stuff hidden by complex menus and such, and most of your actions have a tangible or visible impact.</p>

There is a relatively limited set of choices you can make under normal circumstances: Stellaris is more of a 4x / grand strategy hybrid than a true grand strategy game. Now before we present our top 12 grand strategy games i think it behooves us to define what a grand strategy game is. It is easier to get into for this reason. That or ck2, which is still perfectly fun and entertaining without owning any dlc.</p>
